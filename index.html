            <p>Splendid Cyborg was founded in 2018 as a web and mobile app development consultancy serving savvy
                non-technical startup founders looking for a CTO-for-hire.</p>
            <p>We had a successful run for three years building MVP’s and software engineering organizations for several
                early-stage startups.</p>
            <p>Currently, Splendid Cyborg is reforming as a single-person vehicle for next-gen tech research conducted
                by
                its founder, Ersin Akinci.</p>
            <p>Ersin’s vision is to address social and environmental issues through democratizing technology, whether
                that's in 3D printing, energy, housing, or finance.</p>
            <p>The goal is to create a new startup focused on one of those new technologies, and to build a world-class
                team that's passionate about their potential.</p>
            <p>Interested in teaming up as a co-founder or investor, or do you know someone who would? <a
